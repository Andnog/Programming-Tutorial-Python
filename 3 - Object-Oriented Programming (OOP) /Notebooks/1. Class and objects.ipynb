They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and can be called on both the class itself and instances of the class. Here's an explanation of static methods:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","1. Defining Static Methods:\n","   - Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator followed by the method definition.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     class MyClass:\n","         @staticmethod\n","         def my_static_method():\n","             # Method code here\n","     ```\n","\n","2. Accessing Static Methods:\n","   - Static methods can be accessed using either the class name or an instance of the class.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     MyClass.my_static_method()  # Call on the class\n","     my_instance.my_static_method()  # Call on an instance\n","     ```\n","\n","3. Characteristics of Static Methods:\n","   - Static methods don't have access to instance-specific data (no `self` parameter) or class-specific data (no `cls` parameter).\n","   - They are self-contained and can only access other static methods or class-level attributes (class attributes or other static attributes).\n","   - Static methods are not tied to the instance or the class and can be used when the method doesn't require access to instance or class state.\n","\n","Static methods are useful when you need a method that doesn't rely on any specific instance or class data but is still related to the class conceptually. They provide a way to organize and encapsulate utility methods within a class.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","```python\n","  class Circle:\n","      # Class attribute\n","      pi = 3.14159\n","\n","      def __init__(self, radius):\n","          self.radius = radius\n","\n","      # Static method\n","      @staticmethod\n","      def is_valid_radius(radius):\n","          return radius > 0\n","\n","      def circumference(self):\n","          return 2 * self.pi * self.radius\n","\n","  # Creating a Circle object using a class method\n","  circle = Circle(10)\n","\n","  # Accessing instance attribute\n","  print(circle.radius)  # Output: 5\n","\n","  # Accessing instance method\n","  print(circle.circumference())  # Output: 31.4159\n","\n","  # Calling the static method\n","  print(Circle.is_valid_radius(3))  # Output: True\n","  print(Circle.is_valid_radius(-1))  # Output: False\n","\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"-GN6YtpXYyi1"}}]}
