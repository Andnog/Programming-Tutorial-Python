An object is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint defining the properties (data) and methods (behavior) that the object will possess.

Mocking or substituting dependencies with test doubles becomes simpler, allowing for isolated and focused testing.\n","- **Flexibility:** The DIP promotes a flexible design that allows for easier modification and adaptation. By depending on abstractions, modules can be easily replaced or extended with different implementations without requiring changes to the code that depends on them.\n","- **Reusability:** The use of abstractions and dependency inversion allows for increased code reuse.
