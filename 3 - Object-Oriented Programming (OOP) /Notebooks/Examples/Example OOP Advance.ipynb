Users will be able to search for flights based on criteria such as origin, destination, and date, select seats for their desired flights, and make bookings.\n","\n","## Concepts to be Learned\n","1. Classes and objects\n","2. Encapsulation\n","3. Inheritance\n","4. Polymorphism\n","5. Abstraction\n","6. Interfaces\n","\n","## Requirements\n","Required:\n","- Implement classes to represent flights, seats, and bookings.\n","- Develop methods to search for flights, select seats, and make bookings.\n","\n","Optional:\n","- Implement data persistence to store flight and booking information.\n","- Add additional features like seat availability checking or booking management.\n","\n","## Instructions\n","1. Set up a new Python project in your chosen IDE (e.g., VS Code).\n","2. Define a `Flight` class with the following attributes:\n","   - `flight_number` (string): The unique identifier for the flight.\n","   - `origin` (string): The origin airport of the flight.\n","   - `destination` (string): The destination airport of the flight.\n","   - `departure_time` (datetime): The departure time of the flight.\n","   - `arrival_time` (datetime): The arrival time of the flight.\n","   - Implement the necessary methods to interact with flights, such as searching for flights based on criteria.\n","\n","3. Define a `Seat` class with the following attributes:\n","   - Include additional attributes specific to a seat, such as `seat_number` and `seat_class`.\n","   - Implement any methods specific to managing seats.\n","\n","4. Define a `Booking` class to represent bookings:\n","   - Include attributes such as `passenger_name`, `flight`, and `seat`.\n","   - Implement methods to manage bookings, such as creating new bookings and retrieving booking details.\n","\n","5. Implement the necessary encapsulation mechanisms to protect sensitive data in the classes:\n","   - Use appropriate access modifiers to define public, private, and protected attributes.\n","   - Encapsulate the internal state of the objects to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.\n","\n","6. Utilize inheritance to extend the functionality of the classes:\n","   - Explore opportunities to create subclasses and inherit common attributes and methods from parent classes.\n","\n","7. Apply polymorphism by defining common methods that can be overridden by subclasses:\n","   - Implement polymorphic behavior in methods that perform actions specific to each class.\n","\n","8. Implement abstraction by defining abstract classes or interfaces:\n","   - Define abstract methods or interfaces that specify common behavior for related classes.\n","   - Implement these abstract methods or interface methods in the appropriate classes.\n","\n","9. Create a command-line interface or graphical user interface to interact with the application:\n","   - Display a menu or user interface elements to allow users to search for flights, select seats, and make bookings.\n","   - Take user input and perform the corresponding actions based on their choices.\n","   - Continuously display updated flight and booking information after each operation.\n","\n","10. Test the application by searching for flights, selecting seats, and making bookings to ensure everything functions as expected.\n","\n","11. Optional: Implement data persistence to store flight and booking information:\n","   - Utilize a file-based approach or a database to store and retrieve flight and booking data.\n","\n","12. Optional: Add additional features to enhance the functionality of the application, such as seat availability checking or booking management:\n","   - Implement methods to check seat availability for a specific flight.\n","   - Allow users to manage their bookings by canceling or modifying existing bookings.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HGnR9se3XfB3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["___\n","___\n","# Development step by step"],"metadata":{"id":"zCClssmKbvAe"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 1: Set up a new Python project in your chosen IDE (e.g., VS Code).\n","\n","> Note: In this example using notebooks instead of files o VS Code is OK."],"metadata":{"id":"5KAgT3gGb1q4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 2: Define a `Flight` class with the following attributes:\n","\n","- `flight_number` (string): The unique identifier for the flight.\n","- `origin` (string): The origin airport of the flight.\n","- `destination` (string): The destination airport of the flight.\n","- `departure_time` (datetime): The departure time of the flight.\n","- `arrival_time` (datetime): The arrival time of the flight."],"metadata":{"id":"GbY8o7evcRaJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from datetime import datetime\n","\n","class Flight:\n","    def __init__(self, flight_number, origin, destination, departure_time, arrival_time):\n","        self.flight_number = flight_number\n","        self.origin = origin\n","        self.destination = destination\n","        self.departure_time = departure_time\n","        self.arrival_time = arrival_time"],"metadata":{"id":"iFTJn3KOcWRl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 3: Create a subclass of the `Flight` class called `Seat`:\n","\n","- Include additional attributes specific to a seat, such as `seat_number` and `seat_class`.\n","- Implement any methods specific to managing seats.\n","\n","> Indented block\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PxY1AbIQcXpq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Seat():\n","    def __init__(self, seat_number, seat_class):\n","        self.seat_number = seat_number\n","        self.seat_class = seat_class\n","\n","    def display_details():\n","      print(\"Seat Details:\")\n","      print(\"Seat Number:\", self.seat_number)\n","      print(\"Seat Class:\", self.seat_class)"],"metadata":{"id":"-v6GAx5ucX7D"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 4: Define a `Booking` class to represent bookings:\n","\n","- Include attributes such as `passenger_name`, `flight`, and `seat`.\n","- Implement methods to manage bookings, such as creating new bookings and retrieving booking details."],"metadata":{"id":"eMLYFlVqcksf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Booking:\n","    def __init__(self, passenger_name, flight, seat):\n","        self.passenger_name = passenger_name\n","        self.flight = flight\n","        self.seat = seat\n","\n","    def display_booking_details(self):\n","        print(\"Booking Details:\")\n","        print(\"Passenger Name:\", self.passenger_name)\n","        print(\"Flight Details:\")\n","        print(\"Flight Number:\", self.flight.flight_number)\n","        print(\"Origin:\", self.flight.origin)\n","        print(\"Destination:\", self.flight.destination)\n","        print(\"Seat Details:\")\n","        print(\"Seat Number:\", self.seat.seat_number)\n","        print(\"Seat Class:\", self.seat.seat_class)"],"metadata":{"id":"O0fHDY0QclHD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 5: Implement the encapsulation:\n","\n","- Use appropriate access modifiers to define public, private, and protected attributes.\n","- Encapsulate the internal state of the objects to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access."],"metadata":{"id":"Crw7gPUgcuUY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Flight:\n","    def __init__(self, flight_number, origin, destination, departure_time, arrival_time):\n","        self._flight_number = flight_number\n","        self._origin = origin\n","        self._destination = destination\n","        self._departure_time = departure_time\n","        self._arrival_time = arrival_time\n","\n","    #
