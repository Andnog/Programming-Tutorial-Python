Users will be able to interact with the application through a command-line interface.\n","\n","## Concepts to be Learned\n","1. Classes and objects\n","2. Encapsulation\n","\n","## Requirements\n","Required:\n","- Define a `Task` class to represent individual tasks.\n","- Implement methods to add a task, mark a task as completed, and delete a task.\n","- Provide a command-line interface to interact with the application.\n","\n","Optional:\n","- Implement data persistence to save tasks between sessions.\n","- Add additional features like task prioritization or due dates.\n","\n","## Instructions\n","1. Create a new Python project in your chosen IDE (e.g., VS Code).\n","2. Define a `Task` class with the following attributes:\n","   - `title` (string): The title of the task.\n","   - `describe` (string): The context or information about the task.\n","   - `completed` (boolean): Indicates whether the task is completed or not.\n","3. Implement the following methods in the `Task` class:\n","   - `mark_as_completed()`: Marks the task as completed.\n","   - `delete()`: Deletes the task from the to-do list.\n","4. Create a `ToDoList` class that will manage the tasks:\n","   - Use a list or another appropriate data structure to store the tasks.\n","   - Implement methods to add a task, mark a task as completed, and delete a task.\n","5. Create a command-line interface to interact with the application:\n","   - Display a menu with options to add a task, mark a task as completed, and delete a task.\n","   - Take user input and perform the corresponding action.\n","   - Continuously display the updated to-do list after each operation.\n","6. Test the application by adding, completing, and deleting tasks to ensure everything functions as expected.\n","7. Optional: Implement data persistence to save tasks between sessions.\n","8. Optional: Add additional features to enhance the application's functionality, such as task prioritization or due dates."],"metadata":{"id":"jaLd8KN9VMWI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["___\n","___\n","# Development step by step"],"metadata":{"id":"3oEAwauogqpR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 1: Set up the project\n","\n","- Open your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code) and create a new Python project.\n","- Create a new Python file, e.g., `todo_list.py`, to write your code.\n","\n","> Note:\n","> In this example using notebooks instead of files o VS Code is OK."],"metadata":{"id":"ZsgZuvGIgw03"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 2: Define the Task class\n","\n","- Inside `todo_list.py`, define a class called `Task`.\n","- Add the `__init__` method to initialize the task object with a title and completed status."],"metadata":{"id":"LtQFTshrhHEB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Task:\n","    def __init__(self, title, description):\n","        self.title = title\n","        self.description = description\n","        self.completed = False"],"metadata":{"id":"ByEusJ4JhLnb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 3: Implement task-related methods\n","\n","- Add methods to the `Task` class to mark a task as completed and delete a task.\n","- The `mark_as_completed` method should update the `completed` attribute to `True`.\n","- The `delete` method should remove the task from the to-do list."],"metadata":{"id":"HDjkHxwQhLVw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Task:\n","    def __init__(self, title, description):\n","        self.title = title\n","        self.description = description\n","        self.completed = False\n","\n","    def mark_as_completed(self):\n","        self.completed = True\n","\n","    def delete(self, todo_list):\n","        todo_list.remove(self)"],"metadata":{"id":"tCbeCCKmhWbg"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 4: Create the ToDoList class\n","\n","- Below the `Task` class, define a new class called `ToDoList`.\n","- Add an empty `__init__` method for now.\n","- In the `__init__` method, initialize an empty list to store tasks.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CGYpZ7XDhhwY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class ToDoList:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.tasks = []"],"metadata":{"id":"nxl9yDU4hh-r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 5: Implement methods for managing tasks\n","\n","- Add methods to the `ToDoList` class for adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.\n","- The `add_task` method should create a new `Task` object and append it to the `tasks` list.\n","- The `mark_task_as_completed` method should call the `mark_as_completed` method of the corresponding `Task` object.\n","- The `delete_task` method should call the `delete` method of the corresponding `Task` object."],"metadata":{"id":"muitIiiZhxpj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class ToDoList:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.tasks = []\n","\n","    def add_task(self, title, description):\n","        new_task = Task(title, description)\n","        self.tasks.append(new_task)\n","\n","    def mark_task_as_completed(self, index):\n","        if index < len(self.tasks):\n","            task = self.tasks[index]\n","            task.mark_as_completed()\n","        else:\n","            print(\"\\n--- Task index not found ---\")\n","\n","    def delete_task(self, index):\n","        if index < len(self.tasks):\n","            task = self.tasks[index]\n","            task.delete(self.tasks)\n","        else:\n","            print(\"\\n--- Task index not found ---\")"],"metadata":{"id":"U6v_2TechyVT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 6: Implement the user interface\n","\n","- After the `ToDoList` class, create a function called `main` to handle user interaction.\n","- Inside the `main` function, display a menu with options for adding, marking, and deleting tasks.\n","- Prompt the user for input and call the corresponding methods based on their choice.\n","- Continuously display the updated to-do list after each operation."],"metadata":{"id":"GpkmOA_iiPxN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def main():\n","    todo_list = ToDoList()\n","\n","    while True:\n","        print(\"\\n--- To-Do List ---\")\n","        print(\"1.
