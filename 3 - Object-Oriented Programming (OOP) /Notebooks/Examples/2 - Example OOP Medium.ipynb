Users will be able to interact with the application through a command-line interface.\n","\n","## Concepts to be Learned\n","1. Classes and objects\n","2. Encapsulation\n","3. Inheritance\n","4. Polymorphism\n","\n","## Requirements\n","Required:\n","- Define classes to represent products, customers, and shopping carts.\n","- Implement methods to display products, add products to the shopping cart, and proceed with the checkout process.\n","\n","Optional:\n","- Implement data persistence to store product and customer information.\n","- Add additional features like product filtering or customer account management.\n","\n","## Instructions\n","1. Set up a new Python project in your chosen IDE (e.g., VS Code).\n","2. Define a `Product` class with the following attributes:\n","   - `name` (string): The name of the product.\n","   - `price` (float): The price of the product.\n","   - `description` (string): A brief description of the product.\n","   - `category` (string): The category or type of the product (optional).\n","   - Implement the following methods in the `Product` class:\n","     - `display()`: Display the details of the product, including name, price, description, and category if available.\n","\n","3. Create subclasses of the `Product` class for specific types of products, such as `Clothing`, `Electronics`, or `Books`. Include additional attributes or methods specific to each subclass, if needed.\n","  - Define two subclasses\n","  - Implement any additional methods as needed.\n","\n","4. Define a `Customer` class to represent customers and use encapsulation concept to access this class:\n","   - Include attributes such as `name`, `email`, and `address`.\n","    - `name` as private attribute\n","    - `address` as protected attribute\n","   - Implement any additional methods as needed.\n","\n","5. Define a `ShoppingCart` class to manage the shopping cart:\n","   - Use a list or another appropriate data structure to store the selected products.\n","   - Implement methods to add products to the cart, display the cart contents, and proceed with the checkout process.\n","   - The `add_product` method should take a `Product` object as input and add it to the cart.\n","   - The `display_cart` method should display the products in the cart, including their details, such as name and price.\n","   - The `checkout` method should calculate the total cost of the products in the cart and display the checkout summary, including the customer's information and the total amount. At the end, must empty the cart.\n","\n","6. Create a command-line interface to interact with the application:\n","   - At the beggining add user information taken by user input\n","   - Create a functionality to preload some products and use a list\n","   - Display a menu with options:\n","      - View Products\n","      - Add Product\n","      - Modify Product\n","      - Add Product to Cart\n","      - Display Cart\n","      - Checkout\n","      - Exit\n","   - Take user input and perform the corresponding action.\n","\n","7. Test the application by browsing products, adding them to the cart, and completing the checkout process to ensure everything functions as expected.\n","\n","8. Optional: Implement data persistence to store product and customer information using a file or a database.\n","\n","9. Optional: Add additional features to enhance the application's functionality, such as product filtering by category or customer account management with login and registration functionality."],"metadata":{"id":"G4PL8EgoWYGV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["___\n","___\n","# Development step by
