They provide additional logic and validation when getting or setting attribute values. Getters are used to retrieve the value of an attribute, while setters are used to set the value of an attribute. Attribute getters and setters can be defined using decorators and can have the same name as the attribute.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Attribute getters and setters, also known as accessors and mutators, provide controlled access to class attributes. Here are some use cases for attribute getters/setters:\n","\n","1. Data Validation: Getters and setters allow you to validate the data being assigned to an attribute. You can enforce certain constraints or business rules to ensure that the data remains valid. For example, you can check if a numeric attribute is within a specific range or if a string attribute meets certain criteria.\n","\n","2. Data Conversion: Getters and setters provide a convenient way to convert the data format or type. For example, you can have a setter that converts a string input to an integer or vice versa. This helps ensure consistency and compatibility of data across different parts of the program.\n","\n","3. Access Control: Getters and setters allow you to control the visibility and accessibility of attributes. You can make an attribute read-only by providing only a getter, preventing direct modification of the attribute outside the class. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents unintended modifications.\n","\n","4. Dependency Management: Getters and setters enable you to manage dependencies between attributes or other objects. For example, you can have a setter that updates multiple attributes or triggers certain actions when a specific attribute is modified. This helps maintain consistency and synchronizes related data or behavior.\n","\n","5. Logging and Debugging: Getters and setters provide a convenient place to add logging or debugging statements. You can log attribute changes or add breakpoints within getters and setters to track the flow of data and identify potential issues.\n","\n","6. Compatibility with Existing Code: Getters and setters allow you to introduce attribute modifications or additional processing without breaking existing code that relies on direct attribute access. By keeping the attribute interface consistent, you can make changes internally while maintaining compatibility with external code that uses the getter and setter methods.\n","\n","Overall, attribute getters and setters provide a level of abstraction and control over attribute access, allowing you to enforce rules, manage dependencies, and ensure data integrity within your classes. They promote encapsulation by separating the internal representation of data from the external interface, enabling more robust and maintainable code.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Implementation\n","\n","1. Define a private attribute with a leading underscore (e.g., `_attribute_name`) to indicate that it should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n","2. Create a getter method using the `@property` decorator. This method should return the value of the attribute.\n","3. Optionally, create a setter method using the `@attribute_name.setter` decorator. This method should validate and set the new value for the attribute.\n","4. In the getter and setter methods, use the private attribute to store the actual value.\n","5. Access the attribute using the getter method, and modify it using the setter method.\n","\n","```python\n","class MyClass:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self._attribute_name = None\n","\n","    @property\n","    def attribute_name(self):\n","        return self._attribute_name\n","\n","    @attribute_name.setter\n","    def attribute_name(self, value):\n","        # Optional validation logic\n","        # ...\n","\n","        self._attribute_name = value\n","\n","# Create an instance of the class\n","my_obj = MyClass()\n","\n","# Access the attribute using the getter\n","value = my_obj.attribute_name\n","\n","# Modify the attribute using the setter\n","my_obj.attribute_name = new_value\n","```\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Code example"],"metadata":{"id":"hixepFzcOEDq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Rectangle:\n","    def __init__(self, width, height):\n","        self._width = width\n","        self._height = height\n","\n","    # Getter\n","    @property\n","    def width(self):\n","        return self._width\n","\n","    # Setter\n","    @width.setter\n","    def width(self, value):\n","        if value > 0:\n","            self._width = value\n","        else:\n","            raise ValueError(\"Width must be a positive value.\")\n","\n","    # Getter\n","    @property\n","    def height(self):\n","        return self._height\n","\n","    # Setter\n","    @height.setter\n","    def height(self, value):\n","        if value > 0:\n","            self._height = value\n","        else:\n","            raise ValueError(\"Height must be a positive value.\")\n","\n","    def area(self):\n","        return self._width * self._height\n","\n","# Create a rectangle object\n","rectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)\n","\n","# Get the width and height using the getters\n","print(\"Width:\", rectangle.width)\n","print(\"Height:\", rectangle.height)\n","\n","# Update the width and height using the setters\n","rectangle.width = 7\n","rectangle.height = 4\n","\n","# Get the updated width and height\n","print(\"Updated Width:\", rectangle.width)\n","print(\"Updated Height:\", rectangle.height)\n","\n","# Calculate and print the area\n","print(\"Area:\", rectangle.area())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5X5TsR3dPjP6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687926368043,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Andrei noguera gil","userId":"00676865675105879181"}},"outputId":"2ed50701-02ef-492d-8ce6-8160fd1cabf0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Width: 5\n","Height: 3\n","Updated Width: 7\n","Updated Height: 4\n","Area: 28\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Error setter validation\n","rectangle.width = 0"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":312},"id":"FcCS4nOGQBtK","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1687926370133,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":183,"user":{"displayName":"Andrei noguera gil","userId":"00676865675105879181"}},"outputId":"2fab40d9-2e3b-4e01-dd09-6567031efc30"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"ValueError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mValueError\u001b[0m                                Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-13-f9b66a6792d3>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 2>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# Error validation\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 2\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mrectangle\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mwidth\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m0\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-12-f9c606d2276b>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mwidth\u001b[0;34m(self, value)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     15\u001b[0m             \u001b[0mself\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0m_width\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mvalue\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     16\u001b[0m         \u001b[0;32melse\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 17\u001b[0;31m             \u001b[0;32mraise\u001b[0m \u001b[0mValueError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"Width must be a positive value.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     18\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     19\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;31m# Getter\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mValueError\u001b[0m: Width must be a positive value."]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# <font color='#118ab2'>***Section IV -
