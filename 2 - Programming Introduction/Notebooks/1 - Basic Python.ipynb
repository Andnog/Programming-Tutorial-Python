Conditional statements are also known as decision-making statements. We need to use these conditional statements to execute the specific block of code if the given condition is `True` or `False`.<sup>2</sup> Conditionals are used to create distincts path depending the context, some aplications are: filters, validations, conditional actions, etc.\n","\n","<br>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T93YZcV0OhVA"},"source":["### Behavior\n","\n","Conditionals are based on `boolean` variables, whether the conditional is `True` or `False`.
