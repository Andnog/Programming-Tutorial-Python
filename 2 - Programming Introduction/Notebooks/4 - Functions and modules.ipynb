They take **inputs (called parameters or arguments)** and **optionally return an output** based on the logic defined inside the function. You can **call a function whenever** you need to perform that **specific task, without having to write the code all over again**. Functions help you write more efficient and organized code, and make it easier to debug and maintain.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Concept**\n","\n","![function concept](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iCkOfD0L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1%2A709ugF12LLkYxvb839YNlg.png)\n","\n","### **Implementation**\n","\n","To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a set of parentheses that may or may not contain one or more arguments.
