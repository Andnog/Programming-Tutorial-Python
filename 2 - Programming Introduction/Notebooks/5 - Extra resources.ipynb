There are several ways to format strings in Python, but the most common method is to use the format() method or f-strings (formatted string literals).\n","\n","Using the format() method, you can create a string with placeholders (using curly braces {}) and then pass values to be inserted into those placeholders as arguments to the format() method. Here's an example:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","```python\n","  name = \"John\"\n","  age = 30\n","  city = \"New York\"\n","\n","  message = \"My name is {}, I'm {} years old, and I live in {}.\".format(name, age, city)\n","\n","  print(message)\n","\n","  [out] \"My name is John, I'm 30 years old, and I live in New York.\"\n","```\n","\n","> In this example, we created a string with three placeholders using curly braces {}. We then passed three variables (name, age, and city) as arguments to the format() method to replace the placeholders in the string with their values.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","With f-strings, you can directly insert variables and expressions inside curly braces {} in a string literal. Here's an example:\n","\n","```python\n","  name = \"John\"\n","  age = 30\n","  city = \"New York\"\n","\n","  message = f\"My name is {name}, I'm {age} years old, and I live in {city}.\"\n","\n","  print(message)\n","  [out] \"My name is John, I'm 30 years old, and I live in New York.\"\n","```\n","\n","> In this example, we used an f-string to create a string literal with variables and expressions directly inserted into curly braces {}.
